### repo for big data analysis/ai course final project `IFT512`
Two different instances of using a LSTM neural network to create a stock prediction model. 
- `final_1` is using just the close price to predict future close prices. 
- `final_2` is using all of the available data to predict the open price 30 days into the future. 


Both models are using the `^NYA` stock ticker price with data from yahoo finance from the last 5 years.
